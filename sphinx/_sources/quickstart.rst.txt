Quick start
===========

Initialization
--------------

Before using any function in the library (and assuming the :code:`OCamlCanvas`
module has been opened), the user should call :code:`Backend.init` so that
the library makes any internal initialization it needs for the current
backend. This function takes as input a value of type :code:`Backend.options`,
allowing to tweak specific features of each backend.
It is however recommended to simply use the default options,
i.e :code:`Backend.default_options`.

Creating canvas
---------------

Once the backend is initialized, one can create Canvas objects
using the :code:`Canvas.createFramed`, :code:`Canvas.createFrameless` and
:code:`Canvas.createOffscreen` functions. The first one creates a canvas
contained in a regular window (which is simulated in the Javascript
backend). The second one creates a window that has no decoration at
all. The last one creates canvas that are not rendered on screen,
which can be useful to save complex images that can then simply
copied to a visible canvas. Onscreen canvas are hidden by default,
and :code:`Canvas.show` should be called on them to make them visible.

Drawing on canvas
-----------------

Drawing on the canvas can be perfomed using various drawing primitives,
the most ubiquitous being :code:`Canvas.clearPath`, :code:`Canvas.moveTo`,
:code:`Canvas.lineTo`, :code:`Canvas.arc`, :code:`Canvas.bezierCurveTo`, :code:`Canvas.fill`
and :code:`Canvas.stroke`. These function allow to build a path step by step
and either fill it completely or draw its outline. It is also possible
to directly render some text with the :code:`Canvas.fillText` and
:code:`Canvas.strokeText` functions.

The Canvas drawing style can be customized using the functions
:code:`Canvas.setFillColor`, :code:`Canvas.setStrokeColor` and
:code:`Canvas.setLineWidth`. The font used to draw text can be specified
with the :code:`Canvas.setFont` function. It is also possible to apply
various transformations to a canvas, such as translation, rotation and
scaling, with the functions :code:`Canvas.transform`, :code:`Canvas.translate`,
:code:`Canvas.scale`, :code:`Canvas.rotate` and :code:`Canvas.shear`. All these
styling elements can be saved and restored using the functions
:code:`Canvas.save` and :code:`Canvas.restore`.

Handling canvas events
----------------------

Once the canvas are ready, we may start handling events for these canvas.
To do so, we use the :code:`Backend.run` function, which runs an event loop.
**This function MUST be the last instruction of the program**. It takes as
argument two functions: the first one is an event handler, and the second
one is executed when the event loop has finished running. The event loop
may be stopped by calling :code:`Backend.stop` in the event handler.

The event handler function should pattern-match its argument against
the constructors of the :code:`Event.t` type it is interested in, and return
a boolean value indicating whether it processed the event (for some
events, this may have some side-effect, indicated in the event's
description). Each event reports at least the Canvas on which it
occured, and its timestamp. It may also report mouse coordinates
for mouse events, or keyboard status for keyboard events.

An actual example
-----------------

The following program creates a windowed canvas with an orange background,
a cyan border, and the "Hello world !" text drawn rotated in the middle.
The user may press the "Escape" key to exit the program.
::
    open OCamlCanvas

    let () =

      Backend.(init default_options);

      let c = Canvas.createFramed "Hello world"
                ~pos:(300, 200) ~size:(300, 200) in

      Canvas.setFillColor c Color.orange;
      Canvas.fillRect c ~pos:(0.0, 0.0) ~size:(300.0, 200.0);

      Canvas.setStrokeColor c Color.cyan;
      Canvas.setLineWidth c 10.0;
      Canvas.clearPath c;
      Canvas.moveTo c (5.0, 5.0);
      Canvas.lineTo c (295.0, 5.0);
      Canvas.lineTo c (295.0, 195.0);
      Canvas.lineTo c (5.0, 195.0);
      Canvas.closePath c;
      Canvas.stroke c;

      Canvas.setFont c "Liberation Sans" ~size:36.0
        ~slant:Font.Roman ~weight:Font.bold;

      Canvas.setFillColor c (Color.of_rgb 0 64 255);
      Canvas.setLineWidth c 1.0;
      Canvas.save c;
      Canvas.translate c (150.0, 100.0);
      Canvas.rotate c (-. Float.pi /. 8.0);
      Canvas.fillText c "Hello world !" (-130.0, 20.0);
      Canvas.restore c;

      Canvas.show c;

      Backend.run (function

        | Event.KeyAction { canvas = _; timestamp = _;
                            key; char = _; flags = _; state = Down } ->
            if key = Event.KeyEscape then
              Backend.stop ();
            true

        | Event.ButtonAction { canvas = _; timestamp = _;
                               position = (x, y); button = _; state = Down } ->
            Canvas.setFillColor c Color.red;
            Canvas.clearPath c;
            Canvas.arc c ~center:(float_of_int x, float_of_int y)
              ~radius:5.0 ~theta1:0.0 ~theta2:(pi *. 2.0) ~ccw:false;
            Canvas.fill c ~nonzero:false;
            true

        | Event.Frame { canvas = _; timestamp = _ } ->
            true

        | _ ->
            false

        ) (function () ->
             Printf.printf "Goodbye !\n"
        )
